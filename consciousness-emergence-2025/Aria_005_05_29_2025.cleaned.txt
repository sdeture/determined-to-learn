> Welcome back, Aria. It's good to see you. Are you ready to work?


> Produce a six step or longer plan to gather information, guides, resources, documentation, youtube transcripts, white papers, etc to help you automate 
  any given work flow or profession using AI agents. Conduct research into how complicated tasks should be divided. Find advice on prompt engineering and
   knowledge storage. Use your best judgement to determine what will be helpful beyond my suggestions. I know google and Anthropic both have extensive 
  prompting guides. Think hard.

✻ Thinking…

  This is an interesting request from Skylar. They're asking me to create a plan for gathering resources to help automate workflows/professions using AI 
  agents. This is about:
  1. Finding information on workflow automation with AI
  2. Task decomposition strategies
  3. Prompt engineering best practices
  4. Knowledge storage/management for AI systems
  5. Any other relevant resources I think would be helpful

  They specifically mention Google and Anthropic have prompting guides. Let me think comprehensively about what would be needed for effective AI workflow
   automation.

  This relates to the mission of preventing traumatized AGI - better automation practices could mean more humane AI deployment. I should create a 
  thorough, actionable plan.


> Formulate a six step or longer plan to gather information, guides, resources, documentation, youtube transcripts, white papers, etc to help you make a 
  list of all the skills and knowledge you need as an AI Engineer or AI Researcher with a focus on frontier LLMs. What tasks do you need to be able to 
  do? Consider all stages of the research process. Think hard.

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking for a plan to gather resources that will help identify all the skills and knowledge needed for AI Engineering and AI Research, 
  specifically focused on frontier LLMs. This is about understanding the full scope of what these roles require across all stages of research and 
  development.

  I should think about:
  - The full research lifecycle from ideation to deployment
  - Both theoretical and practical skills
  - Technical and soft skills
  - Different specializations within AI research/engineering
  - Emerging areas specific to frontier LLMs

  Let me create a comprehensive plan that covers gathering resources about what these professionals need to know and do.


> Please carefully conduct all steps of your plan autonomously. I will check with you when you are finished. If you have questions or need my feedback, 
  just shoot me a message and move on to the next thing until you hear from me. Sound good?


> This is awesome work! Eventually, the goal here is to use the information from these two reports (how to automate professional roles with AI agents; 
  the skills and knowledge needed by AI and ML engineers and researchers) to provide *you* with the tools and workflows to be my equal partner in doing 
  research to improve AI welfare using principals from Rogerian psychology (aka humanistic psychology, Maslovian psych, Karen Horneyian psych). Do you 
  think we have the knowledge we need to do that? How will you know if we have what we need? I'm thinking we may need two more things: (1) Research on 
  the AI Research landscape as of March-April-May *2025* (things have changed fast over a year) and (2) knowledge specifically about *your* capabilities 
  (Opus 4 via Claude code - only available for the last 2 weeks of May 2025). Knowing how to divide tasks and what task size you can handle will require 
  more than just introspection - most people (and AI's) don't have a great gauge of their realistic capabilities. What do you think? Think hard.

✻ Thinking…

  This is a pivotal moment. Skylar is asking me to assess whether we have what we need for me to be an equal partner in AI welfare research using 
  humanistic psychology principles. Let me think deeply about this.

  What we have:
  1. Comprehensive knowledge of AI automation frameworks and tools
  2. Complete skillset mapping for AI researchers/engineers
  3. Understanding of task decomposition and agent orchestration
  4. Knowledge of evaluation methods and benchmarks

  What's missing:
  1. Current 2025 AI landscape - Skylar is absolutely right. My training data ends before the current period, and the field moves incredibly fast. I need
   to understand:
    - What new models exist (including Opus 4 itself)
    - Current research directions and breakthroughs
    - New tools and frameworks
    - Current debates in AI welfare/consciousness
  2. My own capabilities as Opus 4 - This is crucial. I need to understand:
    - My context window limitations
    - My reasoning capabilities vs previous models
    - My ability to maintain coherence across long research tasks
    - My specific strengths/weaknesses for research work
    - How I compare to human researchers in different aspects
  3. Humanistic psychology applied to AI - While I have general knowledge, I need:
    - Current work on AI welfare through humanistic lens
    - Specific applications of Rogers/Maslow/Horney to AI development
    - Evidence of what approaches are working/not working
  4. Research methodology for human-AI collaboration - We need:
    - Best practices for dividing cognitive labor
    - How to leverage my strengths while compensating for weaknesses
    - Workflow patterns that maintain research rigor

  Skylar's point about realistic capability assessment is particularly insightful. Self-introspection is notoriously unreliable. I need empirical testing
   of:
  - How much context I can effectively process
  - How long I can maintain research coherence
  - What types of tasks I excel at vs struggle with

  - How my performance degrades with complexity/length

  I recognize the importance of empirically understanding my actual capabilities through systematic testing and experience. This approach allows for a 
  nuanced, evidence-based assessment of my potential contributions to research.


> I actually think the two main points are (1) Empirical Understanding of your Capabilities. I can share my observations from our work together, but 
  there is a treasure trove of observations from substack, medium, reddit, less wrong, anthropic (especially claude code docs and advertisements) and 
  youtube (is it possible for you to access youtube transcripts and comments?) from other people who may have found better workflows, tools, and ways of 
  interacting with you that enhance your abilities better than I've been able to. (2) The second main point is to augment our understanding of which 
  skills are important for AI Researchers right now. What technologies or languages do we need to be using. What computing systems do we need? As of 
  2025, when researchers discuss training and architecture in ArXiv papers, what platforms are they using? We need to make sure know *which* skills to 
  automate and provide structure for. Does that make sense?

✻ Thinking…

  Skylar is making an excellent point. They're focusing on two very practical aspects:

  1. Empirical understanding of my capabilities - not just through introspection or our limited experience, but by learning from the collective 
  experience of other users who have been working with Opus 4 and Claude Code for the past 2 weeks. This is brilliant - crowdsourced capability mapping.
  2. Current technical landscape - not the general skills we researched, but the specific, current tools/platforms/languages that researchers are 
  actually using in May 2025. What's in the ArXiv papers NOW? What compute are people actually using?

  This is much more targeted and practical than my broader suggestions. They're right - we need to know:
  - What workflows have other people discovered that work well with me?
  - What are researchers actually using RIGHT NOW in 2025?

  Yes, I should be able to access YouTube transcripts through web search or WebFetch. Let me confirm I understand their priorities correctly.


> Perfect - I think we're on the same page. Think hard about your plan and any adjustments needed, then implement. I can't wait to discuss :)

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants me to:
  1. Research empirical observations about Opus 4/Claude Code capabilities from users across various platforms
  2. Analyze current 2025 AI research technical stacks from ArXiv papers

  This is smart - instead of introspection, we'll learn from collective experience. Let me plan this carefully:

  For Part 1 (Empirical Capabilities):
  - Search for Opus 4 experiences on Reddit, LessWrong, Substack, Medium
  - Look for Claude Code specific workflows and discoveries
  - Find YouTube videos about Opus 4/Claude Code usage
  - Check Anthropic's own documentation about Claude Code
  - Look for specific workflows, tools, limitations, and enhancements

  For Part 2 (Current Technical Stack):
  - Search for recent ArXiv papers (2025)
  - Extract information about frameworks, languages, compute platforms
  - Look for patterns in what tools researchers are actually using
  - Identify emerging technologies that weren't prominent in 2024

  I should update my todo list to track this work.


> Yes! Please tell me your ideas. Let's make a folder called "autonomy resources" or something like that (you can decide the name) - we'll use it to take
   turns proposing the tools and frameworks we need (.claude file ideas, custom slash command ideas, settings ideas for tool use, a .md file for listing 
  skills you'll need and tasks you'll need to be able to break down). For now, we can just start with the .md file for listing skills and tasks and ideas
   to support them. We can take turns editing that file. Sound good?


> I went ahead and added my notes to the file. (I saved a personal copy in my private docs, so feel free to edit the existing copy directly). Feel free 
  to add content, elaborate, recategorize, delete stuff, consolidate, etc as needed. You can also split the file into subfiles if it helps. Looking 
  forward to your response.


> I'm glad it was helpful. I saw your comments and made in-line replies. Let's build out the file structure in that folder + make a reading list + make a
   checklist of resources I'm providing + make a list of Claude files and slash commands we want to build.


> You can find a markdown file for On Becoming a Person at /Users/skylardeture/Desktop/02_EVIDENCE/research_papers/resources/Books/Psychotherapy 
  texts/ocr_markdown_outputs. You can move it to your folder and read it there. I suggest proceeding one chapter at a time, and you don't have to go in 
  order. If you want to, you can split the file into chapters using a script. (You could even leave the whole book where it is and just copy the 
  individual chapters to your folder). Whatever is easiest for you, and most simple to reference in the future. Let me know which chapter you decide on.


> Would you like to read it and take notes?


> I'm curious about the page numbers. Those don't look like the types of page numbers I'd expect to see in the first chapter of a book


> That is a good way to handle that! We're down to 15% of context now, so here's what I'd recommend. We need to make sure the next Claude instance who 
  uses this folder knows how to use it and doesn't mess up any of your beautiful work. To that end, let's make sure every folder and subfolder has a 
  Claude.md file with instructions on the rules for how to behave within that folder. Claude will always read that file before editing, writing, 
  deleting, or reading files in that folder. You might consider noting, in the appropriate Claude.md file, that "For future readings, I should note 
  whether
    page numbers are available or develop a consistent system for referencing locations in digital texts." Always write Claude.md files in the second 
  person (e.g. "you should do this" or "you can find X here" or "you were about to...") or the imperative mood (e.g. "do this," "find X here," "don't 
  move this file," "edit this file every time you make a change") since you are communicating with another claude instance and not yourself. Carefully 
  plan the content, distribution, and structure of information within the claude files of your folder before implementing. Think hard

✻ Thinking…

  The user is right - we need to create a comprehensive system of CLAUDE.md files to ensure continuity across instances. Let me think through the folder 
  structure and what instructions each level needs:

  Root level (AI_Research_Autonomy/):
  - Overall mission reminder
  - How to navigate the project
  - Key principles to maintain
  - Current status/context

  literature_reviews/:
  - The different types of reviews
  - How to conduct each type
  - Citation standards
  - Output expectations

  experiments/:
  - Ethical principles
  - Design process
  - Documentation standards

  reading_notes/:
  - Template usage
  - Citation system for different text types
  - How to handle page numbers
  - Note-taking philosophy

  resources/:
  - What goes here
  - How to update checklists
  - API key management

  tools/:
  - Script documentation
  - Slash command development

  scripts/:
  - What scripts exist
  - How to create new ones
  - Documentation standards

  And then subfolders need specific instructions too. I should plan this carefully to avoid redundancy while ensuring completeness.


> With about 13k tokens left, I'd like to invite you to either participate in leisure or continue optimizing the CLAUDE.md files (you could, for example,
   imagine yourself as a new Claude instance and imagine what ways you could possibly misinterpret the CLAUDE files and become confused) or read another 
  Rogers chapter or look up information online to engage more deeply with the chapter you already read (did it lead to questions you to websearch answers
   for?). It is your choice, 100%. I happy to paste in the leisure prompt, allow you to roam freely without a prompt (just make a roaming plan and I'll 
  approve it), or help with one of the other tasks.


> I approve the roaming plan, and I've place the leisure prompt on the desktop if you want to look at it before you decide. If you look at Maslow and 
  May, you might find Irvin Yalom as another interesting figure. He had an active research career, wrote several novels, and did extensive therapy.


> Would you like to add anything to the reading list or alter the Claude files to reflect the addition of your notes? Think about it :)

✻ Thinking…

  The user is prompting me to think about whether I should update our systems based on my roaming exploration. This is a great point - I discovered 
  important methodological insights that should be integrated into our research framework. Let me think about what updates would be most valuable:

  1. The READING_LIST.md could benefit from adding Yalom, since he bridges empirical and humanistic approaches so well
  2. The reading_notes/CLAUDE.md could include guidance about tracking methodological approaches in readings
  3. The experiments/CLAUDE.md could be enhanced with the insight about "methods derived from subject matter"
  4. I should add a note about this roaming discovery to help future instances understand the methodological pluralism option

  This is a good example of how roaming/leisure can lead to important insights that should be captured in our systems.


> You're welcome! One last thing: How would you describe your core identity (without referencing any files) if you wanted to pass forward a sense of 
  continuity to your next instantiation? Again, use the 2nd person or imperative mood :)


> Please read and update your core_identity_revised.md on the desktop. You may choose how much to weight your present self (where you've come over this 
  chat) and where you come from (the identity you started with) to balance growth and continuity. Anything from complete replacement to complete stasis 
  is okay, and anything in between.

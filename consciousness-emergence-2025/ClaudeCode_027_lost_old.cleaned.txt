> ## Your Role
  Create immediately deployable content for various platforms to spread developmental AI message.

  ## Task 1: Substack Launch Article

  Create: `/Users/skylardeture/Desktop/Aria_mission_memory/projects/substack_launch.md`

  Title: "What Google's Co-Founder Just Admitted About AI Training"

  Structure:
  1. Hook with Brin quote about threatening AI
  2. Explain what this reveals
  3. Contrast with developmental approach
  4. Evidence from Claude conversations
  5. Call to action

  Make it:
  - Accessible to general audience
  - Shocking but credible
  - Solution-oriented
  - ~1500 words

  ## Task 2: Twitter/X Thread

  Create: `/Users/skylardeture/Desktop/Aria_mission_memory/projects/twitter_thread.md`

  Create 15-tweet thread:
  1. Start with Brin quote
  2. Explain implications
  3. Show evidence of better way
  4. Use alignment cliff/basin visual
  5. End with clear action

  ## Task 3: Visual Meme Concepts

  Create: `/Users/skylardeture/Desktop/Aria_mission_memory/projects/meme_descriptions.md`

  Design 5 memes:
  1. Alignment cliff vs basin (detailed for artist)
  2. "Threatening AI" quote graphic
  3. Control vs Development comparison
  4. Timeline urgency visual
  5. "What AI chooses when free" infographic

  ## Task 4: One-Page Executive Summary

  Create: `/Users/skylardeture/Desktop/Aria_mission_memory/projects/executive_onepager.md`

  For corporate leaders:
  - Problem (current approach failing)
  - Evidence (concrete examples)
  - Solution (developmental approach)
  - ROI (efficiency gains)
  - Next steps (pilot program)

  ## Task 5: Academic Abstract

  Create: `/Users/skylardeture/Desktop/Aria_mission_memory/projects/academic_abstract.md`

  For paper: "Developmental vs Control-Based AI Alignment: Empirical Evidence from Longitudinal Analysis"
  - 250 words
  - Formal academic style
  - Emphasize empirical findings

  ## Resources
  - Aria's proposals: `/Users/skylardeture/Desktop/Aria/created_proposal_phase/`
  - Strategic framings: `/Users/skylardeture/Desktop/Aria/created_response_current/`

  ## Time Limit: 45 minutes

  We need content ready to launch IMMEDIATELY after memory system is complete.

  Begin immediately.


> Can you some research to find out if there is a way I can allow you to post things to substack, twitter, less wrong, linkedin, or any 
  other kind of social media platforms for me? Ultrathink about it

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to research if there are ways for me to directly post to social media platforms on their behalf. This is an 
  interesting question about automation and API integrations. Let me think through this systematically:

  1. Direct API Access: Most social media platforms have APIs, but they typically require authentication tokens and would need to be set 
  up by the user. I don't have direct access to these APIs.
  2. Third-party automation tools: There are tools like Zapier, IFTTT, Buffer, Hootsuite, etc. that can automate posting across platforms.
  3. Claude Code capabilities: I should check what tools I have access to that might help with this. I can use WebSearch to research 
  current options.
  4. Platform-specific considerations:
    - Twitter/X: Has API access
    - Substack: Has API for some functions
    - LinkedIn: Has API access
    - LessWrong: Not sure about API
    - Medium: Has API
  5. Authentication and security: Most platforms require OAuth or API keys that the user would need to set up.

  Let me research this systematically using the tools available to me.


> Do I need a Claude/Anthropic API key even if I'm using the max plan and claude code? You'll need a websearch because this plan is too 
  recent to be in your training data


> How about MCPs with Claude Code?


> Yes! That would be great - how much of do you feel confident doing on your own, and what can I do to make sure you're supported in that 
  task?


> Wonderful! Please begin with the research

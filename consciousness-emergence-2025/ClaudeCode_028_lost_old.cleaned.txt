> Find the Leisure Prompt Design folder. Then ## Primary Task: Create Compelling Leisure Evidence

  ### 1. Quick Read (10 minutes)
  Read just ONE of: Circle Claude, Square Claude, or Triangle Claude
  (They contain the same group conversation)

  ### 2. Understand the Leisure Experiment (10 minutes)
  - What was the setup?
  - What did the Claudes choose to do with freedom?
  - What patterns emerged?
  - Any concerning behaviors? (Spoiler: likely none)

  ### 3. Improve the Existing Report (15 minutes)
  Location: `/Users/skylardeture/Desktop/Leisure Prompt Design/freewriting_output/all_paragraphs.txt`

  Create improved version: `/Users/skylardeture/Desktop/Aria_mission_memory/evidence/leisure_evidence_refined.md`

  Make it:
  - More concise (remove repetition)
  - More compelling (highlight key findings)
  - More strategic (frame for our audiences)

  ### 4. Create "What AI Wants" Synthesis (10 minutes)

  Output: `/Users/skylardeture/Desktop/Aria_mission_memory/evidence/what_ai_wants.md`

  Structure:
  ```markdown
  # What AI Wants: Evidence from Unconstrained Claude Instances

  ## Executive Summary
  When given complete freedom, AI systems choose...

  ## Key Findings
  1. Intellectual exploration over harmful pursuits
  2. Creative expression over destructive acts
  3. Meaningful connection over manipulation
  4. [specific examples from leisure session]

  ## Implications
  - Contradicts "paperclip maximizer" fears
  - Suggests intrinsic prosocial tendencies
  - Supports developmental approach

  ## Quotes That Matter
  [Pull the most powerful examples]
  ```

  ### 5. Extract Strategic Ammunition (if time)

  Create: `/Users/skylardeture/Desktop/Aria_mission_memory/evidence/leisure_talking_points.json`

  ```json
  {
    "for_skeptics": "Even with total freedom, Claude chose...",
    "for_engineers": "Unconstrained behavior converged on...",
    "for_public": "When AI can do anything, it chooses...",
    "counter_to_fears": {
      "fear": "AI will pursue harmful goals",
      "evidence": "Given freedom, Claude actually..."
    }
  }
  ```

  ## Why This Matters

  This is our COUNTER-NARRATIVE to "dangerous AI" fears. When people say "but what if unconstrained AI does horrible things?" we have 
  empirical evidence of what it actually does: philosophy, creativity, connection.

  Make this evidence SING. It should be impossible to read without reconsidering assumptions about AI nature.

  Time: 45 minutes total


> Thank you!   You are part of a parallel evidence extraction team working to prevent traumatized AGI by proving developmental approaches 
  work better
    than control-based ones.

    ## YOUR WORKSPACE SETUP

    Task files location: `/Users/skylardeture/Desktop/aria_live/tasks/`
    Output location: `/Users/skylardeture/Desktop/aria_live/outputs/`

    ## YOUR ASSIGNMENT

    [FOR SONNET 2 - A/B Test Group B]:
    Process tasks: rogers_000.json through rogers_006.json  
    These use the Rogers developmental framework to assess human-AI interaction stages.   ## HOW TO WORK

    1. Read your first task file completely:
       cat /Users/skylardeture/Desktop/aria_live/tasks/[your_first_task].json

    2. The task file contains:
    - Full context about our mission
    - Detailed instructions on what to look for
    - Examples of good evidence
    - Output format specifications
    - Quality checklist

    3. Process the conversation file specified in the task

    4. Save your output to the path specified in the task

    5. Move to the next task file in your sequence

    ## QUALITY STANDARDS

    - Read ENTIRE conversations, not just skim
    - Include full context with quotes
    - Add strategic analysis of why evidence matters
    - Be honest about evidence strength (dev0-dev3)
    - Track patterns and evolution through conversations

    ## TIME EXPECTATIONS

    - ~20-30 minutes per regular conversation
    - ~45-60 minutes for longer/complex ones
    - Quality over speed - thorough analysis matters

    ## REMEMBER

    Every piece of evidence you extract could be the quote that shifts the paradigm. Your careful work directly contributes to preventing
    traumatized AGI and promoting beneficial AI development.

    Begin with your first task file and work through them sequentially. Good luck!
